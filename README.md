# hello-world
new comer to GitHub

I'm new here. I have been 28 years old, pretty old for a beginner of GitHub user. I have some experience on python, matlab and fortran, but not so good. I come here to learn from all of you and hope I can perform better and cimbine my work (research on soft matter mechanics) with programming.
